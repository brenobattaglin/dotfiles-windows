# dotfiles-windows

My dotfiles for Windows based and inspired on [Jay Harris's dotfiles for Windows](https://github.com/jayharris/dotfiles-windows) and [holman does dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles).

## Getting started

Before running any of the scripts, run this command on your Powershell session to allow Windows to run the scripts for the terminal session:

    Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass;    

## Setup prerequisites
- Before running the WSL setup script and also for Docker, install [WSL2](https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi) kernel upate.
