    <h3>Windows dotfiles</h3>

My dotfiles for Windows based and inspired on [Jay Harris's dotfiles for Windows](https://github.com/jayharris/dotfiles-windows) and [holman does dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles).

### Before running any of the scripts, for security reasons, run this command on your Powershell session so the script can work:
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass;
